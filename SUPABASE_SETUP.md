# Supabase Integration Setup Guide

This guide will help you complete the Supabase integration for the Squad GCP Management System.

## 1. Prerequisites

- A Supabase account ([Sign up here](https://supabase.com))
- Your Next.js application is already set up with the required dependencies

## 2. Create Supabase Project

1. Go to [Supabase Dashboard](https://app.supabase.com)
2. Click "New Project"
3. Fill in your project details:
   - **Name**: Squad GCP Management
   - **Database Password**: Choose a strong password
   - **Region**: Choose closest to your users
4. Wait for the project to be created (this may take a few minutes)

## 3. Get Your Supabase Credentials

1. In your Supabase project dashboard, go to **Settings** > **API**
2. Copy the following values:
   - **Project URL** (something like `https://your-project-id.supabase.co`)
   - **anon public key** (starts with `eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...`)

## 4. Configure Environment Variables

1. Open your `.env.local` file in the project root
2. Replace the placeholder values with your actual Supabase credentials:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project-id.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key-here
```

## 5. Set Up Database Tables

1. In your Supabase dashboard, go to **SQL Editor**
2. Copy the contents of `database-setup.sql` file in your project root
3. Paste it into the SQL Editor and click **Run**
4. This will create:
   - `kas` table for financial transactions
   - `anggota` table for member data
   - Row Level Security (RLS) policies
   - Necessary indexes and triggers

## 6. Configure Authentication

The authentication is already set up in the code. Supabase provides:
- Email/password authentication
- Row Level Security to ensure users only see their own data
- Session management

## 7. Test the Application

1. Start your development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

2. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000`
3. You should see a login form
4. Create a new account by clicking "Sign Up"
5. After successful registration/login, you should see the dashboard

## 9. Data Migration (Optional)

If you have existing data in localStorage that you want to migrate to Supabase:

1. Before implementing Supabase, export your localStorage data
2. After setting up Supabase, create a migration script to import the data
3. Use the Supabase client to insert the data into the appropriate tables

## 10. Security Features

- **Row Level Security (RLS)**: Each user can only access their own data
- **Authentication Required**: All operations require user login

- **Lazy Loading**: Components load data only when needed
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with user feedback

## 12. Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **"Invalid JWT" errors**
   - Check that your Supabase URL and anon key are correct
   - Ensure `.env.local` is in the project root and not gitignored

2. **"RLS policy violation" errors**
   - Make sure you ran the database setup SQL
   - Verify that RLS policies are created correctly

3. **Data not showing**
   - Check browser console for errors
   - Verify user is logged in
   - Check that data belongs to the current user

4. **Authentication not working**
   - Check Supabase project settings
   - Verify email templates are configured (for production)

### Debug Steps:

1. Check browser console for JavaScript errors
2. Check Supabase logs in the dashboard
3. Verify database table structure matches the types
4. Test API calls directly in Supabase API docs
